class 7 (1/17/25) - Saturday
week 17 (Armageddon wk 2): student led working sessions

**** deadline for Class 7 Armageddon submissions: 2/3/26 ****

Armageddon repo: https://github.com/BalericaAI/armageddon/tree/main/SEIR_Foundations

Class 7 must do:
- Lab 1, all the way to bonus F 
- Lab 2, all the way to be BAM B 
- Lab 3a and 3b
* the further you go in the labs, the more work ready you become

Any students who were designated as Single A:
- Single A Armageddon FIRST
- Class 7 Armageddon SECOND
* if a student is in Single A, does not complete the Single A Armageddon, and attempts only the Class 7 Armageddon, they will not receive credit for their Class 7 Armageddon contributions.

Any students who also did GCP:
- Above + Lab 4

Any students who were able to complete Labs 1-4
- Lab 5 (red team labs)
Notes:
- only repos are allowed for submissions
- heavily suggested to make submissions within a group
- individual submissions are accepted, but success/progress is unlikely for most
- if code from "repo A" is pirated without attribution/credit and presented in "repo B" as a complete repo for submission, the creators of "repo A" and "repo B" will both be marked as a failure and not accepted for critique
